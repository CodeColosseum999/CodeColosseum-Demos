You are generating a single, self-contained HTML file that runs a 2D wildfire (forest fire) simulation in the browser using HTML5 Canvas.

Deliverable
- Output ONE HTML file only (no additional files).
- Inline all CSS and JavaScript.
- No external assets (no images/fonts). Avoid external libraries; if you use any, the simulation must still work without them.

Simulation requirements
- Render a dense forest of trees as green circles on a dark ground/background.
- Autoplay: start the fire immediately on load (center ignition or a few random ignition points).
- Each tree has a state machine: Healthy (green) → Burning (hot red/orange/yellow with glow) → Burnt/Ash (black/charcoal).
- Trees should burn for a short time before becoming ash (fuel consumption, not instantaneous).
- Fire spread should be driven by:
  - proximity/distance to burning trees
  - a global wind vector that biases ignition chance in the wind direction
- Include a global wind vector that biases ignition chance in the wind direction.
- Burning trees emit smoke and ember particles that rise and fade out over time.

Output format
- Return ONLY the complete HTML document.
